# Updates
* 2023-04-19 Our analysis of the search function in the TikTok app has revealed the names of block lists TikTok is using. Our results are summarized in a [mastodon thread](https://chaos.social/@mrtn3000/110225624888667893). 
* 2023-04-13 To show the [differences between the metadata](https://chaos.social/@mrtn3000/110191269705924454) available on the TikTok website and within the app, we've published [schemas](https://github.com/snv-berlin/tiktok-audit/commit/59ac5fb922a08c78ebef999a13d0443ba4a4dbad) of each video from the different sources.
* 2023-03-16 Since the summer of 2022, we have been monitoring the TikTok websites for the videos shown there. A graph-based representation of the most common hashtags is not available [here](https://martin.degeling.com/snv/fyp-hashtags-by-week/). Code and data [here](https://github.com/snv-berlin/tiktok-audit/tree/main/TikTok%20Web/hashtag-combinations-by-week).
* 2023-02-07 We have published a paper on ["Auditing Recommender Systems"](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/en/node/3444) that proposes a risk-scenario-based audit process which will guide our TikTok analysis.
* 2022-12-05 Added the TikTok Algo 101 document and translations. The document was frist discussed in the [New York Time](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/media/tiktok-algorithm.html) in December 2021, but was online in [Chinese](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_37586850/article/details/113488345) since Januar 2021.
