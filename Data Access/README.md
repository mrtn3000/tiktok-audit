The files in this folder give an overview of the data available on TikTok about videos and authors.
We have compiled lists from the official research API, our scraping of the TikTok.com website and what we gathered from monitoring data used by the mobile app.

The purpose of these files is for:
* researchers to be able to compare the different data sources they could utilize for research projects
* individuals interested in public policy and the Digital Services Act to assess what data TikTok makes available to researchers in comparison to the data they actually have
* everyone to understand what data TikTok is collecting

# Background

In May, we submitted a response to the European Commissionâ€™s call for evidence on a planned Delegated Regulation on data access provided for in the Digital Services Act (DSA). You can access our [comments here](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/sites/default/files/dsa_dataaccess_feedback_snv_2023.pdf).
As part of the submission, we included a (pdf) version of these tables that we have updated, and plan to update, if there are changes.
