### about us

We are independent researchers at [Stiftung Neue Verantwortung](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/en), a Berlin-based, non-profit think tank working on current political and societal challenges posed by new technologies. Learn more about us [here](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/en/subproject/tiktok-audit).


### about the project

Recommender systems play an increasingly important role in the lives of many people. Whether we use a search engine or social media platform, algorithms, artificial intelligence and statistical models determine what, when and how content is presented to users. Despite the importance of these systems for our daily lives, but also the way we inform ourselves and how we communicate with each other, their design is difficult to understand for users as well as for politicians, researchers, and civil society. Whether certain content is systematically disadvantaged or favored, whether recommender systems amplify hate and disinformation, and how user behavior, algorithms, and platform design intertwine are highly relevant questions for democracy. [Our project](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/en/subproject/approaches-analyse-and-evaluate-ai-based-recommendation-systems-internet-intermediaries) is dedicated to studying these issues by closely looing into recommender systems. Within the framework of the project, and given that it impacts billions of users around the world, we have decided to concentrate on TikTok. 

### about this website

In this website -through our [blog](https://tiktok-audit.com/blog/)- we document our journey into exploring TikTok's recommendation algorithms. We have found and learned many interesting things along the way and this is the main space through which we want to share them with interested stakeholders and the general public. Make sure to check out our [news](https://tiktok-audit.com/news/) section to keep up with what we have been up to!
