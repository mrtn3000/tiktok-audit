## about us

We are researchers at [Stiftung Neue Verantwortung](https://www.stiftung-nv.de/en), a Berlin-based, non-profit think tank working on current political and societal challenges posed by new technologies. We do not only invite government officials but everyone seeking information to engage with our work whether through giving us feedback on publications, participating in our events or seeking direct advice. Our experts work independently from partisan interests or political affiliations.
